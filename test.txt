# test questions
# --------------
# rules of test: you can google/search, you can use man or your notes
# timeframe is 2 hours

# 1] download questions according message of the day to the server, under every question write exactly what have you did, what was problem, .... 
#  just report. BOTH, commandline and own words are mandatory
# 2] configure server to allow ssh as root by key
# 3] configure sudo to allow user idontcare to be able to use sudo without password for all commands
#    3.1] why to edit sudoers by something else than standard TXT editor and by what?
#    3.2] what is difference between su and sudo
# 4] start Apache - find what is the problem
# 5] delete files in /home/idontcare/delete_me/; but only delete_me*.to.del in range 0003 to 0105, other should stay intact
# 6] customer is complaining, there are no files in /cdrom directory and he deleted nothing and it stopped to work recently, normally
#   after server reboot some files are presented there
# 7] find biggest files on / filesystem, if something is mounted, do not look there
# 8] there is huge file in /home/idontcare find it and delete it
# 9] do sha256 of iso in /home/idontcare : ad30b003a5face0477177d4980c5c26ba75df21de069612d9fa59ac3ab613aeb
#   9.1] what is reason we do use tools for CRC check?
#   9.2] if you do sha256 to that file and it does not fit with one from example, what does it mean?
#   9.3] do sha512 of same iso, and explain what is diffrence, why?
# 10] can you imagine how to generate (pseudo)random 10 characters long sting [that could be e.g. used as passowrd]
# 11] Every day at 18:15 and 6:15 run following: check how much space is consumed on all disks and save the output to 
#   /tmp/diskfree-<date-timestamp>.log
